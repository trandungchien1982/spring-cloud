== What is this app?

This is an example of a Kafka Streams application in which it shows how to deal with avro records.
To learn more about the details, take a look at the application code and configuration.
There is a supplier provided that produces messages every second, so that we can verify the Kafka Streams processor.

=== Running the app:

Before running the application, please ensure that you have Kafka and Confluent Schema Registry running on default ports (9092, 8081 respectively).
Go to the root of the module: `./mvnw clean pacakge`
Run: `java -jar target/kafka-streams-avro-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`

Here is a sample of the output that you should see on the console:
